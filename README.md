# Transformer Experiments Overview

This repository will explore different model architectures for image segmentation, which will build into Vision Transformers and my experimental implementations of them. This will provide a good benchmark to compare models. Currently, I am using the OxfordIIIPet dataset.

I will divide this repository into two sections with multiple experiments, each exploring a different model architecture:

Section 1 (Image Classification):
    - Experiment 1: CNN
    - Experiment 2: Resnet
    - Experiment 5: Vision Transformer
    - Experiment 6: Inception ViT
    - Experiment 7: QKV ViT

Section 2 (Image Segmentation):
    - Experiment 1: CNN
    - Experiment 2: Resnet
    - Experiment 3: Unet
    - Experiment 4: Unet w/ Attention
    - Experiment 5: Vision Transformer
    - Experiment 6: Inception ViT
    - Experiment 7: QKV ViT

# Section 1 - Image Classification

## Experiment 1 - CNN

Currently a work in progress.
